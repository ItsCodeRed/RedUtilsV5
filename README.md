## Notes

- The original version of RedUtils was made for RLBot v4. This is a basic port of RedUtils to RLBot v5. I will continue to update this version until it is equivalent to the v4 version. Until then, feel free to make a pull request if anything isn't working!
- Bot name, description, etc, is configured by `bot.toml`
- Bot strategy is controlled by `Bot/Bot.cs`
- Bot appearance is controlled by `loadout.toml`
- To make your bot run as fast as possible, build it in release mode, and then change the "run_command" in `Bot.toml` to `.\\Bot\\bin\\Release\\net8.0\\Bot.exe`
- See the [wiki](https://github.com/RLBot/RLBotCSharpExample/wiki) for tips to improve your programming experience.
- If you'd like to keep up with bot strategies and bot tournaments, join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/q9pbsWz). It's the heart of the RLBot community!
